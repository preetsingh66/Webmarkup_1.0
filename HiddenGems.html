          <h1>Eye Filmmuseum</h1>
          <p>
            Eye Filmmuseum in <em>Amsterdam</em> is dedicated to preserving film
            heritage, promoting Dutch and foreign cinema, and hosting events.
            Its unique building resembles an eye and overlooks the IJ river. The
            Filmmuseum was located in Kriterion and Stedelijk Museum until 1975,
            when de Vaal succeeded in acquiring a discrete space for the
            Filmmuseum in the Vondelpark Pavilion. In 2009, Nederlands
            Filmmuseum merged with Holland Film, the Netherlands Institute for
            Film Education and the Filmbank and plans were announced for a new
            home on the north bank of <em>Amsterdam's</em> waterfront. The
            Filmmuseum was renamed the Eye Film Institute Netherlands and was
            officially opened on April 4, 2012, by Queen Beatrix.

          <h1>The Oude Kerk</h1>
          <p>
            The Oude Kerk is the oldest existing building in
            <em>Amsterdam</em> and is located on Oudekerksplein in the
            <em>Amsterdam</em>-Centrum district. The church was dedicated
            (probably in 1306) to Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, during the
            time of Guy of Avesnes, Bishop of Utrecht. Until the Alteration
            (1578), the church was Roman Catholic and was called St. Nicholas
            Church. Saint Nicholas was, the patron saint of sailors and was
            especially venerated in port cities. The current St. Nicholas Church
            in the city center of <em>Amsterdam</em> was only built in the
            period 1884-1887. In September 2006, the 700th anniversary of the
            use of the Oude Kerk was celebrated.

          <p>
            The Westerpark is a public urban park in <em>Amsterdam</em>,
            Netherlands. The former borough of Westerpark is named after the
            park, as is the current neighborhood. The verdant space of the
            former Westergasfabriek gasworks along Haarlemmerweg has become a
            place for cultural avant-garde businesses. Up until the early
            seventeenth century, the Haarlemmerdijk constitutes the only
            connection between Haarlem and <em>Amsterdam</em>. Its name,
            Overbraker Binnenpolder, probably refers to its frequent floods. A
            few farms are built along this dike between <em>Amsterdam</em> and
            Sloterdijk, then the first village on the road to Haarlem. In 1845,
            <em>Amsterdam's</em> first municipal park, the Westerplantsoen, is
            created on the Overbraker Binnenpolder.
