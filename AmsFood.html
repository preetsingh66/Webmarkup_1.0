          <em>Café-Restaurant 't Heemelrijck on Van Woustraat, Amsterdam</em>,
          is back. Since 1949, this family-run eatery has been dishing up
          classic Dutch fare like chowder and stew. Founded as a sandwich shop
          by Grandpa Nars, it evolved into a successful restaurant in 1964. In
          1976, it became Amsterdam's first French bistro with a Dutch twist. In
          2010, the second generation passed the torch, but the itch remained.
          Now, with the third generation, it's a new beginning at Van Woustraat

          The Oude Kerk is Amsterdam's oldest building, situated in the
          Amsterdam-Centrum district on Oudekerksplein. Initially dedicated to
          Saint Nicholas in 1306, it was known as St. Nicholas Church. After the
          Alteration in 1578, it ceased to be <em>Roman Catholic</em>. The
          current St. Nicholas Church in central Amsterdam was built in
          1884-1887. In 2006, the 700th anniversary of Oude Kerk's use was
          celebrated, and a replica of the lost Angelus bell was reinstalled in
          2016. Today, Oude Kerk hosts both ecclesiastical functions and
          site-specific exhibitions.

        <h1>Restaurant Moeders</h1>
        <p>
          Moeders (= Dutch for mothers) opened in 1990. The owner asked all his
          guests to bring a plate, glass and cutlery during the opening. With
          all those different plates, wineglasses and cutlery the wooden tables
          in the restaurant are still set today.Today, 30 years since the
          opening, the walls in the restaurant are filled with hundreds of
          framed and unframed pictures along with antique pans, plates and
          biscuit tins. <em>Moeders </em>is known for several Dutch
          specialities. If you want to enjoy a typical Dutch treat they serve a
          Dutch ricedish. You don't get any rice, but all little bits and pieces
          of traditional Dutch home cooking. And for those who don't want to
          enjoy all of this, there are plenty of other things to chose from the
          extensive, international menu.

          In April 2010 we opened our doors at Javaplein in Amsterdam East. For
          us, a Modern Dutch kitchen means: ingredients from Dutch soil, whereby
          the more local the ingredients come from, the better. We cook
          seasonal,<em> vegetarian</em> and use sustainable fish and game as
          much as possible.
